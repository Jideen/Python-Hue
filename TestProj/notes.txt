if playing on TV set global token to current token DONE
Check isUser boolean and then execute album art script DONE
if bool = false, then set bool to true. If false, DONE
check tokens again to see which one is active when DONE
device name contains 'XBR-49.' If same, check again in ten DONE

invalidate other tokens
Potential solution: Use all tokens assigned to different
variables and functions, only use active tokens, but keep
inactive tokens valid
