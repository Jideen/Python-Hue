TODO: Load spotify profiles of all users
TODO: Check which user is casting to TV
TODO: set cover art script to use current
TODO: User's spotify auth token

HOWDO:
------
Create tokens for all accounts DONEish
Check each token for current playback state DONEish
if playing on TV set global token to current token
Check isUser boolean and then execute album art script
if bool = false, then set bool to true. If false,
check tokens again to see which one is active when
device name contains 'XBR-49.' If same, check again in ten
seconds, if changed, set global token and repeat.
Additional: Print real name associated with current Spotify
account.
Additional: Implement forever python script to ensure crash is
not fatal
Port to Raspberry pi for passive running
VERIFY: Only one auth token must be issued per user Yes
VERIFY: Switching User token in use will not
invalidate other tokens
Potential solution: Use all tokens assigned to different
variables and functions, only use active tokens, but keep
inactive tokens valid
